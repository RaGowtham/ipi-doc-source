## Download Ubuntu Desktop image

Before downloading Ubuntu image, you have to ensure which ROS distribution you want to use, and then download the right Ubuntu distribution supporting the ROS distribution you choose.

For example, here we want to install ROS 2 Dashing, so we find the document from [ROS website](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/) telling us that ROS 2 Dashing binary packages are supported on **Linux (Ubuntu Bionic(18.04))** platform.

Then we can download Ubuntu Desktop 18.04.3 LTS from [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

## Create a bootable microSD card or USB stick

In order to create a bootable microSD card or USB stick for later installation, it's recommended to download [**Rufus**](https://rufus.ie/) and use it to flash your bootable media with Ubuntu image.

Below picture shows how to use Rufus, just select the right device and image, and then click `START` button to flash the selected device. For detailed instructions, please visit the [pages](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1) from Ubuntu website.
